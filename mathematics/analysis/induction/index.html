<p>Last time we defined the set of natural numbers <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> axiomatically using Peano's axioms. The last axiom, known as Peano's Induction Postulate, gave us a powerful proof technique called the Principle of Mathematical Induction. Let's quickly recall this technique.</p>
<p>Suppose for each <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span> we have some statement or proposition <span class="arithmatex">\(P_n\)</span>, and we would like to show that all such propositions are true. The Principle of Mathematical Induction tells us we only have to show two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(P_1\)</span> is true,</li>
<li>if <span class="arithmatex">\(P_n\)</span> is true, then <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{n+1}\)</span> is true as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's take a look at some examples.</p>
<h1 id="induction-examples">Induction examples</h1>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>Prove that for all <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>, we have</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\sum_{k=1}^n (2k-1) ~=~n^2
\]</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> We first want to prove that the above equality holds  when <span class="arithmatex">\(n=1\)</span> (the base case). We have</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\sum_{k=1}^1 (2k-1) ~=~ 2\cdot 1 - 1 ~=~ 1^2.
\]</div>
<p>So the claim is true when <span class="arithmatex">\(n=1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose the claim is true for some <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>. We want to show that it must then be true for <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span> as well (the induction step). We have</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{align*}\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} (2k-1) &amp;~=~2(n+1)-1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k-1)\\
 &amp;~=~ 2(n+1)-1 + n^2\end{align*}
\]</div>
<p>with the last equality following from our assumption that the claim it true for for <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>. Finally we note that</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{align*}
2(n+1)-1 + n^2 &amp; ~=~ n^2 + 2n+1~=~ (n+1)^2.
\end{align*}
\]</div>
<p>Hence, the claim holds for <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span>. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the equality holds for all <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Notice that in each of the two examples that we've considered (the first of which was the example we looked at last time), in order to prove the claim is true for <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span> we rewrote the proposition in a way that allowed us to employ our assumption that the claim is true for <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>. For example, we wrote</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} (2k-1)}_{(n+1)^\mathrm{st}~\text{case}}~=~2(n+1)-1 + \underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k-1)}_{n^\mathrm{th}~\text{case}}.
\]</div>
<p>This will happen in all of your induction proofs (it's the idea that is fundamental to induction), so keep this in mind if you get stuck.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Example #2</p>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(0\leq a \leq 1\)</span>, prove that for all <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span></p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
(1-a)^n \geq 1-na.
\]</div>

<summary>Example #2 Proof</summary>

<div class="arithmatex">\[
(1-a)^1~=~1-a ~=~1-1\cdot a.

<p>Hence, the claim is in fact true when <span class="arithmatex">\(n=1\)</span>.</p>

 &amp;~\geq~ (1-a)(1-na)

\]</div>
<p>with the inequality following from our assumption that the claim is true for <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>. Continuing on we get</p>

\begin{mdframed}\begin{exc} Prove that for any <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>, it is possible to tile any <span class="arithmatex">\(2^n\times 2^n\)</span> grid with \emph{any} one square removed using tiles of the following shape:
[\begin{tikzpicture}

<p>\begin{proof} We want to first consider the base case. When <span class="arithmatex">\(n=1\)</span>, we need to tile a <span class="arithmatex">\(2\times 2\)</span> grid,

<p>In fact, to make our proof a bit more compact, we could have assumed without loss of generality that the removed square is the upper right-hand corner; since if this were not the case, we could simply rotate the grid.</p>
<p>Let <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span> and suppose that any <span class="arithmatex">\(2^n\times 2^n\)</span> grid can be tiled with exactly one square removed. We need to use this to show that any <span class="arithmatex">\(2^{n+1}\times 2^{n+1}\)</span> grid can also be tiled in this way. Note that any <span class="arithmatex">\(2^{n+1}\times 2^{n+1}\)</span> grid will be of the form:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[\begin{tikzpicture}

<p>Notice that each of the larger squares are <span class="arithmatex">\(2^n\times 2^n\)</span>, and therefore can be tiled with any one square removed. In fact, we can tile the squares on the left and the square on the bottom right so that the missing square is the one touching the center.</p>

Since the missing squares in the center can be tiled in, we see that the claim holds for <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span>. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, it holds for all <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>.
\end{proof}
\end{exc}
\end{mdframed}\medskip</p>
<p>\noindent From the above examples it may seem that proof by induction is both powerful and foolproof. However, one needs to be careful when proving the inductive step. Let's look at a cautionary example.\bigskip</p>
<p>\begin{mdframed}
\begin{exc} \emph{Claim}: For each <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>, any group of <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> people will have the same name.</p>
<p>\begin{proof}[A flawed proof.] We first consider the base case. Clearly in any group of size <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> everyone will have the same name! As usual, the base case is easy.</p>
<p>Now, let <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span> and suppose any group of <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> people will have the same name. We want to show that any group of people of size <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span> will also have the same name. Let <span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_1,\dots, p_{n+1}\}\)</span> denote a group of people of size <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span>. By the induction hypothesis, the people in the group <span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_1,\dots,p_{n}\}\)</span> all have the same name. Similarly, the people in the group <span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_2,\dots,p_{n+1}\}\)</span> have the same name. Since  the people <span class="arithmatex">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p_{n+1}\)</span> have the same name as people in the group <span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_2,\dots,p_{n}\}\)</span>, everyone must have the same name.
\end{proof}</p>
<p>So where is the mistake in this proof? In the inductive step you consider an \emph{arbitrary} <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>. You cannot make any assumptions about this <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> other than the fact that it is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. In the above proof, the group of <span class="arithmatex">\((n+1)\)</span> people is broken into two subsets. This first subset <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_1,\dots,p_n\}\)</span>\)</span> is obtained by excluding the person <span class="arithmatex">\(p_{n+1}\)</span>, and the second subset  <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_2,\dots,p_{n+1}\}\)</span>\)</span> is obtained by excluding the person <span class="arithmatex">\(p_1\)</span>. Since both of these groups are of size <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>, we know that everyone must have the same name. It is then argued that everyone in the intersection of these two sets <span class="arithmatex">\(<span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_1,\dots,p_n\}\cap\{p_2,\dots,p_{n+1}\}~=~\{p_2,\dots,p_n\}\)</span>\)</span> must have the same name, and therefore the people <span class="arithmatex">\(p_1\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(p_{n+1}\)</span> must also share this name. However, this intersection <span class="arithmatex">\(\{p_2,\dots,p_n\}\)</span> is nonempty if and only if <span class="arithmatex">\(n\geq 2\)</span>! So we see that the above argument would fail for <span class="arithmatex">\(n=1\)</span> in particular.</p>

<h1 id="overview-of-the-course">Overview of the course</h1>
<p>This course is titled Analysis, which is a very vague title. Analysis of what? Well, typically this course would be titled something along the lines of (an introduction to) Real Analysis.</p>
<p>The <em>Real</em> in that title is due to the fact that we will restrict our attention to the real numbers, as opposed to Complex Analysis which would consider (you guessed it) the complex numbers. We will be studying the real numbers themselves, sequences and series of real numbers, and real-valued functions (functions whose outputs are real numbers). Why study these objects? Well, beyond being interesting in their own right, understanding these objects will allow us to rigorously develop the theory covered in a basic calculus course.</p>
<p>By rigorous, we mean that the focus in this course will be on <em>why</em> things work, whereas in previous courses, the focus was on <em>how</em> things work. For example, in calculus you learn when and <em>how</em> to apply the Chain Rule of differentiation. In this course, we will give a rigorous mathematical proof of the chain rule and in so doing (hopefully!) come to an understanding of <em>why</em> it works.</p>
<p>In this first chapter we will study the number systems underlying much of the subsequent theory. Namely, the set of natural numbers, rational numbers, and real numbers. We begin with the a system you've been using since you could first count, the natural numbers.</p>
<h1 id="the-natural-numbers">The natural numbers</h1>
<p>The set of natural numbers (sometimes called the counting numbers), is the set of positive whole numbers:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[\{1,2,3,4,5,\dots\}.\]</div>
<p>This set is commonly denoted by <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Some define <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to be all non-negative integers (i.e. they include <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span>), and this is a perfectly fine choice to make. Doing so results in only cosmetic changes to what we are about to discuss.</p>
<p>Now, you're no doubt familiar with the natural numbers and very adept at using them, however, we want to define <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> axiomatically. What this means that we will give a minimal list of statements (axioms) that describe <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> uniquely. These axioms are known as Peano's axioms, and we begin with the most basic:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Axiom 1 (A1)</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Note that if we had defined the natural numbers to be all <em>non-negative</em> integers, the <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> in the above axiom would be replaced by a <span class="arithmatex">\(0\)</span>. Obviously, we need more than just one element on our set <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, and to define the other elements we will employ the next axiom:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Axiom 2 (A2)</p>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, its <em>successor</em> <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span> is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>If we're being truly rigorous here, you might notice that we're cheating a bit - we haven't defined what <span class="arithmatex">\(+\)</span> means! However, we'll skip over this for the moment. So what do we have thus far? Well, we know that <span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> by <strong>A1</strong>, and <strong>A2</strong> tells us that <span class="arithmatex">\(2=1+1\)</span> is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Since <span class="arithmatex">\(2\)</span> is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> (which we denote by <span class="arithmatex">\(2\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>) we can employ <strong>A2</strong> once again to see that <span class="arithmatex">\(2+1=3 \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. You can see where we're going here. So are we done? Do <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong> completely define <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>?</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<p>Can you come up with a set of numbers <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span> that satisfies the above axioms, but is not <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>?</p>
</div>
<p>If you attempted the above exercise, you may have realized that there are a many possible sets that are not <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, but satisfy <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong>. Let's consider a few of example sets to help motivate our remaining axioms. Keep in mind that some of these examples are <em>not</em> obvious, and you wouldn't be expected to come up with them on your own.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The axioms <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong> do not preclude the possibility of non-positive numbers being elements of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. For example, the set of all whole numbers (also known as the integers) <span class="arithmatex">\(\{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots\}\)</span> satisfies both <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong>, but clearly this set is not <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next example is a somewhat pathological possibility that you may not have considered.  Suppose we have the set <span class="arithmatex">\(\{1,2,\alpha,3,4,5,\dots\},\)</span> where <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha + 1 = 3\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha \neq 2\)</span>. Notice that this set satisfies <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong>, but such an element <span class="arithmatex">\(\alpha\)</span> is not a member of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, consider the set <span class="arithmatex">\(\left\{1,\frac{3}{2},2,\frac{5}{2}, 3, \frac{7}{2},\dots\right\}.\)</span> While this set is not <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, you can verify that it satisfies  <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will introduce three more axioms that will address the above examples. Let's start with the first example. To preclude non-negative numbers in our set, we consider the following axiom:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Axiom 3 (A3)</p>
<p><span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> is not the successor of any element of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Before moving on, take a moment to think about how would these first three axioms would have to be changed if we defined <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> to include 0, that is, if we defined <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the pathological possibility given in example 2 still satisfies <strong>A1</strong>, <strong>A2</strong>, and <strong>A3</strong>. The issue that this example is illustrating is that our axioms do not preclude two distinct elements of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> from sharing the same successor! We can remove this possibility with the following axiom:\bigskip</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Axiom 4 (A4)</p>
<p>If <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> and <span class="arithmatex">\(m\)</span> have the same successor, then <span class="arithmatex">\(n=m\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Finally, we consider example 3. You should verify that the set in example 3 satisfies <strong>A1</strong>, <strong>A2</strong>, <strong>A3</strong>, and <strong>A4</strong>. Our final axiom will remove the possibility that there are additional, unwanted numbers in our set <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, and do so in a very clever way.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Axiom 5 (A5 - Peano's Induction Postulate)</p>
<p>Let <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span> be a set. If</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(1\)</span> is an element of <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span>, and</li>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span> is an element <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span> whenever <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> is,</li>
</ol>
<p>then <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is a subset of <span class="arithmatex">\(S\)</span>, which we denote <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\subset S\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>You're probably asking yourself how the above axiom finally nails down <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Well, by <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong> we know that the set <span class="arithmatex">\(\{1,2,3,4,\dots\}\)</span> is contained in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, that is,</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\{1,2,3,4,\dots\}~\subset~\mathbb{N}.
\]</div>
<p>In fact, this is the only set that we can conclude is contained in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> from <strong>A1</strong> and <strong>A2</strong>. That is, while the previous axioms do not <em>preclude</em> a set such as</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\left\{1,\frac{3}{2},2,\frac{5}{2}, 3, \frac{7}{2},\dots\right\},
\]</div>
<p>from being contained in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>, they do not go so far as to say that such a set is contained in <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Now, the last axiom <strong>A5</strong> gives us the inclusion</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathbb{N}~\subset~\{1,2,3,4,\dots\}.
\]</div>
<p>If we put these two inclusions together, we see that</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathbb{N} ~=~ \{1,2,3,4,\dots\}.
\]</div>
<p>These five axioms uniquely define the natural numbers <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. While we won't employ the first four very often, the last axiom is a very powerful tool.</p>
<h1 id="the-principle-of-induction">The principle of induction</h1>
<p>Often in mathematics, you find yourself with list of statements or propositions <span class="arithmatex">\(P_1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(P_2\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(P_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\dots\)</span>, which you would like to prove are all true. For example, for each natural number <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> (which we can write more succinctly as <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in\mathbb{N}\)</span>), let <span class="arithmatex">\(P_n\)</span> be the proposition that the following equality is true:</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k ~=~\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
\]</div>
<p>While determining if the above equality is true for a specific <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>, say <span class="arithmatex">\(n=5\)</span>, is easy enough, how would you go about proving that the equality holds for <em>all</em> <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>?</p>
<p>Note that another way of saying that the propositions <span class="arithmatex">\(P_1\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(P_2\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(P_3\)</span>, <span class="arithmatex">\(\dots\)</span>, are true, would be to say that the set of <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span> for which <span class="arithmatex">\(P_n\)</span> is true, is all of <span class="arithmatex">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>. Or notationally,</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\{n\in \mathbb{N} : P_n\text{ is true}\} ~=~ \mathbb{N}.
\]</div>
<p>By <strong>A5</strong>, in order to show the above equality we just need to show two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="arithmatex">\(P_1\)</span> is true,</li>
<li>If <span class="arithmatex">\(P_n\)</span> is true, then <span class="arithmatex">\(P_{n+1}\)</span> is true.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we prove the above two statements, then <strong>A5</strong> tells us that</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathbb{N}\subset \{n\in \mathbb{N} : P_n\text{ is true}\}.
\]</div>
<p>However, we already know that the opposite inclusion holds, that is,</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\{n\in \mathbb{N} : P_n\text{ is true}\}\subset \mathbb{N}.
\]</div>
<p>When we put the above inclusions together, we get</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\mathbb{N}~=~ \{n\in \mathbb{N} : P_n\text{ is true}\}!
\]</div>
<p>This proof technique is called the Principle of Mathematical Induction, and it is both simple and powerful.</p>
<p>Let's see this technique in action by considering the example given above.</p>
<div class="admonition example">
<p class="admonition-title">Exercise</p>
<p>Prove that for all <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>,</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\sum_{k=1}^n k~=~ \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.
\]</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong>
We first want to prove that the above equality holds when <span class="arithmatex">\(n=1\)</span>. This is typically referred to as the <em>base case</em>. We have,</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\sum_{k=1}^1 ~=~ 1 ~=~ \frac{1(1+1)}{2}.
\]</div>
<p>Hence, the base case it true.</p>
<p>Next, suppose the equality holds for <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>. We will use this to show that it must hold for <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span> as well. This is typically referred to as the <em>induction step</em>. We have</p>
<div class="arithmatex">\[
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k &amp;~=~ (n+1) + \sum_{k=1}^{n} k
~=~ (n+1) + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
~=~ \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}.
\end{align*}
\]</div>
<p>Hence, if the equality holds for <span class="arithmatex">\(n\)</span>, it also holds for <span class="arithmatex">\(n+1\)</span>. By the principle of mathematical induction, we see that the equality must hold for all <span class="arithmatex">\(n\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We'll look at several more examples of the proofs using the principle of mathematical induction in the next lecture.</p>
